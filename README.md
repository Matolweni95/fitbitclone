📘 Project Info

This project was originally intended to be built using React. I began development with that in mind, but later realized that React was not allowed for the task. Unfortunately, I only discovered this limitation after some progress had already been made.

As a result, while the final implementation doesn't use React, you might notice traces of that early planning in the structure or code style.
